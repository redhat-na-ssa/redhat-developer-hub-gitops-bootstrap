# Overview

The GitLab operator is responsible for managing the full lifecycle of GitLab instances in your Kubernetes or Openshift container platforms.

[Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/operator.html)

The operator, while new and still actively being developed, aims to:
- ease installation and configuration of GitLab instances
- offer seamless upgrades from version to version

# Prerequisites

Please visit [Prerequisites](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/operator.html#prerequisites) section of GitLab Operator Documentation.

## IngressClass

Cluster-wide `IngressClass` should be created prior to Operator setup, as OLM does not currently support this object type:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: IngressClass
metadata:
  # Ensure this value matches `spec.chart.values.global.ingress.class`
  # in the GitLab CR on the next step.
  name: gitlab-nginx
spec:
  controller: k8s.io/ingress-nginx
```
